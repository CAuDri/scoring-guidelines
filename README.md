This document aims to summarize the subset of regulations of the official
[CAuDri Challenge regulations](https://caudri-challenge.de/regulations/)
which specify the referees' scoring decisions. It is only for educational
purposes, thus it has no legal meaning for the competition (in contrast to
the official regulations document).
